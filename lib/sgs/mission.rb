# ABSTRACT
# Mostly this class is for the overall daemon running on Mother. It takes
# care of listening for GPS updates and adjusting the sailing route,
# accordingly. It is responsible for keeping MissionStatus up to
# date. The actual mission information is stored in a YAML file.
#

##
# Routines for handling sailboat navigation and route planning.
#
require 'yaml'

module SGS
  #
  # Handle a specific mission.
